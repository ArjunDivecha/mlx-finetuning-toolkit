## 🎮 **How to Use**

### **1. Launch the Application**
```bash
cd "/Users/macbook2024/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/AAA Backup/A Working/Arjun LLM Fine Tuner/mlx-finetune-gui"
npm run dev
```

### **2. Application Workflow**
1. **Setup Page**: 
   - Select base model from dropdown
   - Use "Browse" buttons to select training/validation JSONL files
   - Configure hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, etc.)
   - Click "Start Training"

2. **Training Page**: 
   - Monitor real-time training progress
   - View live loss charts
   - Watch training logs stream
   - Control training (pause/stop)

3. **Results Page**: 
   - Review training completion statistics
   - Analyze training metrics and performance

4. **Compare Page**: 
   - Test base model vs fine-tuned model responses
   - Side-by-side comparison interface

### **3. Production Build**
```bash
npm run build  # Build everything
npm run dist   # Create macOS installer (.dmg)
```
