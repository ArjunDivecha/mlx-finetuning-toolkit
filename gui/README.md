## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- macOS with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3.9+ with venv
- MLX environment already set up at:
  `/Users/macbook2024/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/AAA Backup/A Working/Arjun LLM Writing/local_qwen/.venv`

### ✅ Installation (NPM Issues Resolved!)

**Status**: ✅ All dependencies successfully installed and tested!

#### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)
```bash
cd mlx-finetune-gui
./start.sh
```

#### Option 2: Manual Installation
```bash
# 1. Install root dependencies (bypasses npm cache permission issues)
cd mlx-finetune-gui
npm install --cache /tmp/npm-cache --no-optional

# 2. Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install --cache /tmp/npm-cache --no-optional

# 3. Install backend dependencies
cd ../backend
source "/Users/macbook2024/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/AAA Backup/A Working/Arjun LLM Writing/local_qwen/.venv/bin/activate"
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: The npm permission issues have been completely resolved using temporary cache directories.

### Development

Start the development environment:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will:
- Start the FastAPI backend on port 8000
- Start the React frontend development server
- Launch the Electron app

## 🏛️ Architecture Details

### Backend (FastAPI)
- **REST API** for configuration and control
- **WebSocket** for real-time training updates
- **Training Manager** handles MLX training processes
- **File monitoring** parses training logs for metrics

Key endpoints:
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /models` - List available models
- `POST /training/start` - Start training
- `POST /training/stop` - Stop training
- `WS /ws` - WebSocket for real-time updates

### Frontend (React + Redux)
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Chart.js** for metrics visualization
- **WebSocket client** for real-time updates

Key store slices:
- `trainingSlice` - Training state and metrics
- `modelsSlice` - Available models
- `uiSlice` - UI state and preferences

### Electron (Main Process)
- **Process management** for backend server
- **File dialogs** for dataset selection
- **Menu system** with keyboard shortcuts
- **Window management** and app lifecycle

## 📁 Key Files

### Backend
- `backend/main.py` - Main FastAPI server with training management
- `backend/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Main React app component
- `frontend/src/store/store.ts` - Redux store configuration

## 🔌 Integration Points

### MLX Training Integration
The app integrates with your existing MLX fine-tuning system:
- Uses the same venv: `/Users/.../local_qwen/.venv`
- Calls `run_finetune.py` with generated config
- Monitors training logs for metrics extraction
- Manages LoRA adapter outputs

### File System Integration
- **Models**: Auto-discovers from `base_model/` directory
- **Datasets**: File picker for JSONL training data
- **Outputs**: LoRA adapters saved to `lora_adapters/`
- **Logs**: Training logs in `logs/` directory

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Backend won't start**: Check Python venv path in `src/main.ts`
2. **Models not listed**: Verify model directory structure and permissions
3. **Training fails**: Check MLX environment and dependencies
4. **WebSocket disconnects**: Backend server may have crashed

### Debugging
- Backend logs: Check terminal output when running `npm run dev`
- Frontend logs: Open DevTools in Electron window
- Training logs: Check the generated log files in `logs/` directory

## 🔮 Next Steps

### Phase 1: Complete MVP
1. Finish React components for all pages
2. Implement WebSocket real-time updates
3. Create training configuration forms
4. Add basic error handling

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features

2. Comprehensive testing
3. Performance optimization
4. Documentation and help system

## 📝 Code Patterns

### State Management
```typescript
// Use Redux Toolkit for all state
const dispatch = useAppDispatch();
const trainingState = useAppSelector(state => state.training.state);
```

### API Calls
```typescript
// Use axios for HTTP requests
const response = await axios.post('/api/training/start', config);
```

### WebSocket Communication
```typescript
// Use custom hook for WebSocket
const { connect, disconnect, send } = useWebSocket();
```

### File Operations
```typescript
// Use Electron IPC for file dialogs
const result = await window.electron.showOpenDialog(options);
```
